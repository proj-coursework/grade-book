# Progress: Grade Book

## Current Status: Production Ready System

The Grade Book is a **fully functional, production-ready system** that has been successfully implemented and is actively used for academic grade management. This is not a project in development, but rather a mature tool with complete functionality.

## What Works (Implemented Features)

### âœ… Core Data Processing Pipeline

- **Gradescope Processing** (`src/process.ts`): Converts raw Gradescope exports into clean, structured data

  - Handles missing assignments (fills with zeros)
  - Sorts assignments alphabetically for consistency
  - Generates metadata JSON with assignment information
  - Removes unnecessary columns (submission times, lateness data)

- **Grade Aggregation** (`src/aggregate.ts`): Calculates weighted grades and statistics
  - Configurable assignment categories with custom weights
  - Automatic percentage calculations for each category
  - Letter grade assignment based on configurable cutoffs
  - Statistical analysis (mean, median, standard deviation)
  - Grade distribution metrics

### âœ… Export Generation

- **Canvas Integration** (`src/canvas.ts`): Generates Canvas-compatible import files

  - Student matching between Canvas export and grade data
  - Proper CSV formatting for Canvas import
  - Error reporting for unmatched students
  - Maintains Canvas-required column structure

- **SIS Integration** (`src/sis.ts`): Creates SIS-ready Excel files
  - Simple two-column format (ID, Grade)
  - Excel (.xlsx) file generation
  - Letter grade export for final grade submission

### âœ… Reporting and Visualization

- **Individual Reports** (`src/report.ts`): Detailed student grade breakdowns

  - Markdown format for easy reading
  - Three-level detail: final grade, category scores, individual assignments
  - Assignment weights and maximum points included
  - Organized in `data/${CURRENT_CLASS}/reports/` folder

- **Grade Distribution Charts** (`src/chart.ts`): Visual grade analysis
  - PNG chart generation using Chart.js
  - Configurable display options (cutoff labels, colors)
  - Bar chart showing grade distribution
  - Saved as `grade_distribution.png` in class folder

### âœ… Configuration Management

- **Environment-based Setup**: Uses `.env` file for current class selection
- **Type-safe Configuration**: TypeScript interfaces for all config objects
- **Flexible Course Structure**: Supports any combination of assignment categories
- **Custom Grade Cutoffs**: Configurable letter grade boundaries

### âœ… Error Handling and Validation

- **Student Matching Errors**: JSON reports for Canvas/grade data mismatches
- **Data Validation**: Checks for missing assignments and data inconsistencies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing when possible
- **Audit Trail**: All intermediate files preserved for verification

### âœ… Development Infrastructure

- **TypeScript Setup**: Full type safety with strict configuration
- **Package Management**: pnpm with workspace support
- **Code Quality**: Prettier formatting, type checking scripts
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with step-by-step instructions

### âœ… Example Scripts and Utilities

- **Multi-Section Support** (`examples/combine_sections_assignments.ts`): Combines section-specific assignments
  - Merges assignments with section suffixes (e.g., "Quiz 3 - Section 1" + "Quiz 3 - Section 2" â†’ "Quiz 3")
  - Processes `gradescope_processed.csv` to handle multi-section courses
  - Preserves original data structure while combining related assignments
  - Addresses roadmap requirement for multi-section course support

## What's Left to Build (Future Enhancements)

### ðŸ”„ Current Roadmap Task: Remove Audit Students Script

**Status**: Ready to implement
**Priority**: High - Needed for courses with audit students

**Requirements**:

- Create `examples/remove_audit_students.ts` script
- Remove audit students from `gradescope_processed.csv` file
- Expect `audit.csv` file in course data folder with same format as gradescope raw data
- Match students by SID and remove them from processed data
- Preserve original file structure and format

**Implementation Approach**:

- Read `audit.csv` file to get list of audit student SIDs
- Filter `gradescope_processed.csv` to exclude audit students
- Generate new processed file without audit students
- Document usage in examples README

### ðŸ”® Potential Future Improvements

#### API Integration

- **Canvas API**: Direct grade upload without manual import
- **SIS API**: Automated final grade submission
- **Gradescope API**: Automatic data export (if available)
- **Challenge**: Authentication, permissions, API rate limits

#### Enhanced Error Handling

- **Detailed Error Messages**: More specific guidance for common issues
- **Automatic Fixes**: Suggest corrections for data inconsistencies
- **Validation Warnings**: Alert for potential configuration problems

#### User Interface Improvements

- **Web Interface**: Replace command-line with browser-based tool
- **Progress Indicators**: Show processing status for large datasets
- **Interactive Configuration**: GUI for setting up class configurations

#### Advanced Analytics

- **Trend Analysis**: Grade progression over time
- **Comparative Statistics**: Compare across different semesters
- **Predictive Modeling**: Early warning for struggling students

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Streaming Processing**: Handle larger datasets efficiently
- **Parallel Processing**: Speed up chart generation and calculations
- **Caching**: Store intermediate results for faster re-runs

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Constraints

- **Manual Export/Import**: External systems require manual file operations
- **Single Section Limitation**: Cannot handle multi-section courses automatically
- **Memory Usage**: Loads entire CSV files into memory
- **Error Resolution**: Requires manual intervention for student matching issues

### Technical Debt

- **Minimal**: Code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive and up-to-date
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents most runtime errors

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Linear Pipeline**: Chosen for simplicity and debuggability over complex orchestration
- **Local Processing**: Privacy and simplicity over cloud-based solutions
- **TypeScript**: Type safety over JavaScript flexibility
- **File-based Storage**: Simplicity over database complexity

### Configuration Approach

- **Environment Variables**: Simple class selection mechanism
- **Co-located Config**: Class configuration lives with data for organization
- **Type-safe Config**: Prevent configuration errors at compile time

### Error Handling Philosophy

- **Transparent Errors**: Generate detailed reports rather than silent failures
- **Manual Resolution**: Human oversight for critical decisions (student matching)
- **Fail-safe Operations**: Never modify original data files

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Efficiency Gains

- **Time Reduction**: Manual grade processing reduced from hours to minutes
- **Error Reduction**: Automated calculations eliminate transcription errors
- **Consistency**: Standardized workflow across all courses

### User Adoption

- **Active Use**: System is currently being used in production
- **Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive README enables self-service setup
- **Flexibility**: Adapts to different course structures without code changes

### Technical Quality

- **Code Maintainability**: Clear structure with TypeScript type safety
- **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss through immutable processing pipeline
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all grade transformations

## Maintenance Status

### Current State

- **Stable**: No critical bugs or missing functionality
- **Well-documented**: README and memory bank provide complete context
- **Type-safe**: TypeScript prevents most common errors
- **Tested**: Proven through real-world academic use

### Ongoing Needs

- **Memory Bank Maintenance**: Keep documentation current with any changes
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular npm package updates for security
- **Documentation Updates**: Reflect any workflow improvements or new features

The Grade Book represents a successful automation project that has achieved its primary goals of streamlining academic grade management while maintaining data integrity and providing comprehensive audit trails.
