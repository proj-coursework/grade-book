- ✅ Processes `gradescope_processed.csv` to combine assignments with section suffixes
- ✅ Generates new processed file with combined assignments
- ✅ Addresses multi-section course support roadmap item

### Recently Completed Task: Remove Audit Students Script

**Status**: ✅ Complete - Audit student removal script implemented

**Completed**:

- ✅ Created `examples/remove_audit_students.ts` script
- ✅ Removes audit students from `gradescope_processed.csv` file
- ✅ Expects `audit.csv` file in course data folder with same format as gradescope raw data
- ✅ Matches students by SID and removes them from processed data
- ✅ Preserves original file structure and format
- ✅ Creates backup files with `_with_audit` suffix
- ✅ Generates detailed removal report in JSON format
- ✅ Updates metadata with correct student count
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation added to examples README

### Project State Assessment

The Grade Book project appears to be a **mature, functional system** with:

- Complete core functionality implemented
- Comprehensive documentation in README
- Working TypeScript codebase with proper dependencies
- Clear workflow for grade processing pipeline

## Recent Changes

### Memory Bank Structure

- Established 6-file memory bank structure following .clinerules guidelines
- Created comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of the system
- Documented the linear pipeline architecture and 6-layer system pattern

### Key Insights Discovered

#### System Maturity

- This is a **production-ready** system, not a new project
- All core scripts are implemented and functional
- Documentation suggests active use in academic environment

#### Architecture Strengths

- **Clean separation of concerns**: Each script has single responsibility
- **Immutable data pipeline**: Original files never modified
- **Type-safe configuration**: TypeScript ensures configuration correctness
- **Error handling**: JSON error reports for manual resolution

#### Workflow Efficiency

- **Automated processing**: Manual steps minimized to data export/import
- **Audit trail**: All transformations preserved in intermediate files
- **Flexible configuration**: Easy adaptation to different course structures

## Next Steps and Active Decisions

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ **Complete Memory Bank**: All core files created and documented
2. ✅ **Validate Documentation**: Memory bank accurately reflects the mature, production-ready system
3. **Ready for Development**: Memory bank provides complete context for any future enhancements or maintenance

### Potential Enhancement Areas

#### Multi-Section Support (Roadmap Item)

- **Current Limitation**: Single section per class
- **Proposed Solution**: Post-processing scripts to combine section-specific assignments
- **Example**: Combine "Quiz 3 - Section 1" and "Quiz 3 - Section 2" into "Quiz 3"

#### Error Handling Improvements

- **Current State**: JSON error reports require manual resolution
- **Potential Enhancement**: More detailed error messages and suggested fixes
- **User Experience**: Clearer guidance for resolving common issues

#### Workflow Automation

- **Current State**: Manual export/import steps for external systems
- **Future Possibility**: API integration with Canvas/SIS for direct uploads
- **Technical Challenge**: Authentication and permission management

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Management

- **Environment-based class selection**: `CURRENT_CLASS` environment variable
- **Co-located configuration**: Class config lives with data in `data/${CURRENT_CLASS}/`
- **Type safety**: Strong TypeScript types for all configuration objects

### Data Processing Philosophy

- **Immutability**: Never modify source files
- **Traceability**: Every transformation creates intermediate files
- **Error transparency**: Generate detailed error reports for manual review
- **Idempotency**: Scripts can be run multiple times safely

### File Organization Strategy

- **Data isolation**: Each class gets its own folder
- **Clear naming conventions**: Consistent file naming across all classes
- **Documentation co-location**: README files with data for tracking changes

## Learnings and Project Insights

### System Design Decisions

#### Why Linear Pipeline Architecture?

- **Debugging**: Each stage can be tested independently
- **Flexibility**: Instructors can stop/restart at any point
- **Transparency**: Clear data flow from input to output
- **Error isolation**: Problems can be traced to specific stages

#### Why TypeScript Over JavaScript?

- **Configuration safety**: Catch config errors at compile time
- **IDE support**: Better autocomplete and error detection
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting code with type annotations
- **Academic environment**: Students benefit from type safety examples

#### Why Local Processing Over Cloud?

- **Data privacy**: Grade data never leaves instructor's machine
- **Simplicity**: No authentication or network complexity
- **Reliability**: No dependency on external services
- **Cost**: No ongoing service fees

### User Experience Insights

#### Instructor Workflow Optimization

- **Minimal learning curve**: Standard command-line tools
- **Clear error messages**: JSON reports with actionable information
- **Flexible adjustments**: Custom scripts for special cases
- **Audit trail**: Complete documentation of all changes

#### Student Impact

- **Faster feedback**: Automated posting reduces delay
- **Transparency**: Detailed reports available on request
- **Consistency**: Standardized calculations across all students
- **Accuracy**: Reduced human error in grade calculations

### Technical Insights

#### CSV Processing Patterns

- **Header-based parsing**: Robust against column reordering
- **Missing data handling**: Fill with zeros for missing assignments
- **Alphabetical sorting**: Consistent assignment ordering

#### Student Matching Strategy

- **SID as primary key**: Reliable across all systems
- **Error reporting**: Track unmatched students for manual resolution
- **Flexible matching**: Support for different ID formats

#### Statistical Analysis Approach

- **Standard metrics**: Mean, median, standard deviation
- **Grade distribution**: Visual representation of class performance
- **Category breakdown**: Detailed analysis by assignment type

## Current Development Environment

### Active Configuration

- **Node.js**: ES Modules with TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficiency
- **Code Quality**: Prettier for consistent formatting
- **Type Checking**: Strict TypeScript configuration
