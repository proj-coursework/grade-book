# Documentation

The `guides/` directory contains developer-focused guides to help understand the project setup and development practices. These guides are designed to be educational and provide detailed explanations of selected topics relevant to the project that I believe an inexperienced developer would find useful. They are not exhaustive but aim to cover essential aspects of the project.

The `memory-bank/` directory contains the core project documentation, which is essential for understanding the architecture, design decisions, and current status of the project. This documentation is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the project and its components. It is crucial for onboarding new developers and maintaining a clear understanding of the project's evolution.

The `index.md` file serves as the main entry point for the documentation, providing a brief documentation of the project from the user's perspective. Since this project is designed to be used by developers (instructors or TAs), the `index.md` will remain empty.
